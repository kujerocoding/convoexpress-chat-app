2. Open a terminal and navigate to the backend folder. Run the command 'npm install' to install the required dependencies.
3. In a separate terminal, navigate to the frontend folder. Again, run 'npm install' to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Start the backend server by running 'npm start' in the backend terminal.
5. In the frontend terminal, run 'npm run dev' to start the development server for the frontend.
6. To test the application, you can use the following login credentials: username: charlie, password: charlie. Alternatively, you can register your own account.
